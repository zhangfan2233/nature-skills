#
# update-codex-skills.sh — install / update Nature Skills into Codex.
#
# Codex loads skills from ~/.codex/skills/. This script copies every skill
# folder shipped in this repository's skills/ directory (the 10 nature-*
# skills plus the shared _shared/ dir) into that location.
#
# It is intended for users who install the skills by manual copy rather than
# via the Codex plugin marketplace. Running it again later updates an existing
# install to the current contents of this checkout.
#
# Safety: it syncs ONLY the skill folders found in this repo, each in isolation.
# Any other skills you keep in ~/.codex/skills/ (e.g. pdf, playwright) are left
# completely untouched.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/update-codex-skills.sh           # copy this checkout's skills into Codex
#   PULL=1 scripts/update-codex-skills.sh    # `git pull --ff-only` first, then copy
#   CODEX_SKILLS_DIR=/path scripts/update-codex-skills.sh   # override destination
#
